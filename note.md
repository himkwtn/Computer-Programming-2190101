## The study of lights in the sky.

## The sky inspires ideas of

- mystery
- respect
- amazement
- perfection
- immensity
- immutability

## Astronomy is connected to

**Non-science**

- **Philosophy**: trying to find answers to profound questions
  - ex. Why are we here?
- **Religion**: Organizing our beliefs about transcendental matters
  - God, afterlife
- **Astrology**: Trying to find effects of the celestial bodies in our lives and to predict the future
  - fortune telling

**Science**

- **Cosmology**: desciribing the universe as a whole

- **Mathematics**: Using abstraction and reasoning on problems of measurement and claculation
- **Physics**: Describing the phenomena that occur in nature

## **Instruments**: The "naked eye"

- **Available since**: always
- **Observations possible:**
  - The Sun and The Moon
  - Stars: about 1k
  - Planets: 5
  - COmets
  - Other nebulous objects: less than 20
  - The Milky Way

## **Obsevations:** The Sun and the Moon

- **Instrument required:** naked eye
- **First observed:** prehistory
- **Conslusions:**
  - Sun produces day/night
  - Moon has ohases with constant period (month)
  - Day/night duration related to season (year)

## **Applications:** The sundial

- **Observations needed:** Sun
- **First time used:** prehistory
- **Important examples:**
  - Egyptian
  - Babylonian
- Helps measure time of the day

## **Applications:** The calendar

- **Observations needed:** Sun and Moon
- **First time used:** prehistory
- **Important examples:**
  - Sumerian
  - Mayan
  - Greek etc.
- Helps measure long time periods and predict seasons

## **Obsevations:** Stars and planets

- **Instrument required:** naked eye
- **First observed:** prehistory
- **Conslusions:**
  - Stars do not change position with respect to other stars
  - Planets change position continuously

## **Applications:** The Atrolabe

- **Observations needed:** Sun, Moon, stars, planets
- **First time used:** 200 BC
- Analog calculator
- Helps locate and predict positions of astronomical bodies; calculate geographic position and local time
- Useful for the navigation and astronomical studies

## **Obsevations:** The Milky Way

- **Instrument required:** naked eye
- **First observed:** prehistory
- A slightly brighter stripe in the sky
- Visible only during very dark nights
- **Conslusions:** ...
